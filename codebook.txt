====
Basic Design of phone data set
The phone data set consists of 180 rows of 81 variables. The first two variable identifies the type of activity and the subject (as indexed in the raw data) respectively. The following variables contains umerical measurements collected from each subject during the trial. The variables are listed means or standard deviations of different types of measurements. 

Activity: (factor)--describes types of activities
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

Subject:(integer)---describes subjects 
As indexed in the raw data package. 

Measurement Variables (numeric)
Variables that computed means or standard deviations of different types of
measurements were retained from the original data set, and the means of each of these variables are presented in this dataset. Refer to the original dataset for detailed descriptions.
